## Regular lattice and spatial weight matrix

Spot based data is collected along a regular spaced grid where all sample areas have the same size. Such a grid is also called a regular lattice. In more rigorous terms the data $Y$ is the result of a random process but the sampling locations are fixed along a lattice $D$. The lattice $D$ does not have to be regular but in the scope of spot based data it is. Spot-based data is generated by a defined sampling strategy, whereas point pattern data is the result of a stochastic process [@zuurAnalysingEcologicalData2007].

The lattice is composed of individual spatial units

$$D = \{A_1, A_2,...,A_n\}$$

where these units do not overlap

$$A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \forall i \neq j$$

The data is then a random variable of the spatial unit along the lattice

$$Y_i = Y(A_i)$$

Most lattice data analysis technique build on the concept of neighbours. Therefore, the spatial relationship can be modelled with e.g. a spatial weight matrix $W$. There are a lot of ways to define a spatial weight matrix $W$. For example, the spatial weight matrix can be defined as a binary contiguity matrix where adjacent units are indicated by one and non-adjacent units as zero.

$$w_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } A_i \text{ and } A_j \text{ are adjacent}\\ 0 \text{ otw} \end{cases}$$

other options to specify the weight matrix $W$ are mentioned in @zuurAnalysingEcologicalData2007. 

`Voyager` has a special function for the construction of the weight matrix in Visium data `findVisiumGraph`.
