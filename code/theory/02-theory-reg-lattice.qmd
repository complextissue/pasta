## Regular lattice and spatial weight matrix

Spot based data is collected along a regular spaced grid where all sample areas have the same size. Such a grid is also called a regular lattice. In more rigorous terms the data $Y$ is the product of a random process but the sampling locations are fixed along a lattice $D$. The lattice $D$ does not have to be regular but in the scope of spot based data it is. The main difference of this type of data in comparison to point patterns is that the locations of the data are not results of a stochastic process but rather due to a defined sampling strategy [@zuurAnalysingEcologicalData2007].

The lattice is composed of individual spatial units

$$D = \{A_1, A_2,...,A_n\}$$

where these units do not overlap

$$A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \forall i \neq j$$

The data is then a random variable of the spatial unit along the lattice

$$Y_i = Y(A_i)$$

Most lattice data analysis technique build on the concept of neighbours. Therefore, the spatial relationship can be modelled with e.g. a spatial weight matrix $W$. There are a lot of ways to define a spatial weight matrix $W$. For example, the spatial weight matrix can be defined as a binary contiguity matrix where adjacent units are indicated by one and non-adjacent units as zero.

$$w_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } A_i \text{ and } A_j \text{ are adjacent}\\ 0 \text{ otw} \end{cases}$$

other options to specify the weight matrix $W$ are mentioned in @zuurAnalysingEcologicalData2007. 

`Voyager` has a special function for the construction of the weight matrix in Visium data `findVisiumGraph`.
