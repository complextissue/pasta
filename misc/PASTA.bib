	abstract = {Over the last two decades spatial point pattern analysis (SPPA) has become increasingly popular in ecological research. To direct future work in this area we review studies using SPPA techniques in ecology and related disciplines. We first summarize the key elements of SPPA in ecology (i.e. data types, summary statistics and their estimation, null models, comparison of data and models, and consideration of heterogeneity); second, we review how ecologists have used these key elements; and finally, we identify practical difficulties that are still commonly encountered and point to new methods that allow current key questions in ecology to be effectively addressed. Our review of 308 articles published over the period 1992–2012 reveals that a standard canon of SPPA techniques in ecology has been largely identified and that most of the earlier technical issues that occupied ecologists, such as edge correction, have been solved. However, the majority of studies underused the methodological potential offered by modern SPPA. More advanced techniques of SPPA offer the potential to address a variety of highly relevant ecological questions. For example, inhomogeneous summary statistics can quantify the impact of heterogeneous environments, mark correlation functions can include trait and phylogenetic information in the analysis of multivariate spatial patterns, and more refined point process models can be used to realistically characterize the structure of a wide range of patterns. Additionally, recent advances in fitting spatially-explicit simulation models of community dynamics to point pattern summary statistics hold the promise for solving the longstanding problem of linking pattern to process. All these newer developments allow ecologists to keep up with the increasing availability of spatial data sets provided by newer technologies, which allow point patterns and environmental variables to be mapped over large spatial extents at increasingly higher image resolutions.},

SPARK directly models spatial count data through generalized linear spatial models. It relies on recently developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, providing effective control of type I errors and yielding high statistical power. With a computationally efficient algorithm, which is based on penalized quasi-likelihood, SPARK is also scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples. Analyzing four published spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets using SPARK, we show it can be up to ten times more powerful than existing methods and disclose biological discoveries that otherwise cannot be revealed by existing approaches.},

	abstract = {The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index (P̃*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index (H̃), a spatial relative diversity index (R̃), and a spatial dissimilarity index (D̃). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index P̃*—which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals’ local spatial environments—and the spatial information theory index H̃—which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual—are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

Recent technological advances in next-generation sequencing- and imaging-based approaches have established the power of spatial transcriptomics to measure expression levels of all or most genes systematically throughout tissue space, and have been adopted to generate biological insights in neuroscience, development and plant biology as well as to investigate a range of disease contexts, including cancer. Similar to datasets made possible by genomic sequencing and population health surveys, the large-scale atlases generated by this technology lend themselves to exploratory data analysis for hypothesis generation. Here we review spatial transcriptomic technologies and describe the repertoire of operations available for paths of analysis of the resulting data. Spatial transcriptomics can also be deployed for hypothesis testing using experimental designs that compare time points or conditions—including genetic or environmental perturbations. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data are naturally amenable to integration with other data modalities, providing an expandable framework for insight into tissue organization.},

However, distinguishing the boundaries of individual cells in such data is challenging and can hamper downstream analysis. Current methods generally approximate cells positions using nuclei stains. We describe a segmentation method, Baysor, that optimizes two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell boundaries considering joint likelihood of transcriptional composition and cell morphology. While Baysor can take into account segmentation based on co-stains, it can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. To evaluate performance, we extend multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to incorporate immunostaining of cell boundaries. Using this and other benchmarks, we show that Baysor segmentation can, in some cases, nearly double the number of cells compared to existing tools while reducing segmentation artifacts. We demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics.},

Developers of analytical tools need to decide on the intrinsic molecular features of each cell that need to be considered, and how cell shape and morphological features are incorporated into the analysis.

We profiled {\textasciitilde}1 million cells, identified {\textasciitilde}70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.},

Using simulated and real vessel reporting data, the properties of this new interpretation of spatial mutual information are explored. The utility of the technique in detecting spatial boundaries between regions of data having diﬀerent statistical properties is examined. The technique is shown to successfully identify vessel traﬃc boundaries, crossing points between traﬃc lanes, and transitions between regions having diﬀering vessel movement patterns.},

To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used.

In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data. Voyager has comprehensive tutorials demonstrating ESDA built on GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and scalability, using data from popular commercial technologies. Voyager is implemented in both R/Bioconductor and Python/PyPI, and features compatibility tests to ensure that both implementations return consistent results.},

We demonstrate that spatial molecular imaging has high sensitivity (one or two copies per cell) and very low error rate (0.0092 false calls per cell) and background ({\textasciitilde}0.04 counts per cell). The imaging system generates three-dimensional, super-resolution localization of analytes at {\textasciitilde}2 million cells per sample.

Here, we introduce SpatialDM, a statistical model and toolbox leveraging a bivariant Moran’s statistic to detect spatially co-expressed ligand and receptor pairs, their local interacting spots (single-spot resolution), and communication patterns. By deriving an analytical null distribution, this method is scalable to millions of spots and shows accurate and robust performance in various simulations. On multiple datasets including melanoma, Ventricular–Subventricular Zone (SVZ), and intestine, SpatialDM reveals promising communication patterns and identifies differential interactions between conditions, hence enabling the discovery of context-specific cell cooperation and signalling.},

This study devises an L statistic by integrating Pearson's r as an aspatial bivariate association measure and Moran's I as a univariate spatial association measure.

Nearest-neighbor contingency tables for two species can be analyzed using the methods in Dixon (1994). Here, I present methods to analyze contingency tables for any number of species. Calculation and interpretation of the multispecies contingency table are illustrated by two examples: spatial segregation of species in a swamp forest, with five types of points (Fraxinus caroliniana, Nyssa sylvatica, Nyssa aquatica, Taxodium disticum, and “other species”), and spatial segregation in the gamodioecious tree Nyssa aquatica, with three types of points (male, female, and juvenile). Two issues that affect the results and their interpretation are the choice of randomization (random labelling or toroidal rotation) and the choice of test (pairwise or multispecies).},

A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local “pockets” of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

	abstract = {AbstractSpatial clustering has important implications in various fields. In particular, disease clustering is of major public concern in epidemiology. In this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to test the significance of disease clustering among subjects whose locations are from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the segregation indices and compare them with other distance-based disease clustering tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate the sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern (e.g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of clustering and number of clusters, or to differences in relative abundances of the classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundances have the highest influence on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power performances of the tests under these alternatives. We observe that the empirical size of one of the indices is more robust to the differences in relative abundances, and this index performs comparable with the best performers in literature in terms of power. We illustrate the methods on two real-life examples from epidemiology. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This allows the complex cellular architecture and environment of diseased tissue to be explored. While spatial analysis techniques have revealed how cell–cell interactions are important within the disease pathology, there remains a gap in exploring changes in these interactions within the disease process. Specifically, there are currently few established methods for performing inference on cell-type co-localization changes across images, hindering an understanding of how cellular environments change with a disease pathology.We have developed the spicyR R package to perform inference on changes in the spatial co-localization of types across groups of images. Application to simulated data demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity.

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software.},

If we consider simultaneously two species, the main question is not to describe the marginal distribution of each species but to describe the relationship between the repartitions of the two species under study. The relationship between two clouds of points can be described in various ways and therefore many indices can be defined. Each index will give a specific information about these relationships and will greatly depends on the ecological mechanisms, i.e., the point process that leads to the observed repartition. The aim of this article is to review the leading indices in ecology and to provide guidelines for practical use. To mimic ecological situations, we simulated 13 point process that can model classical relationships between two species of trees and compute nine classical indices. The interest of the various indices are discussed. A R package for simulating the point process and to compute the indices is available on request.

In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {The use of summary statistics beyond the two-point correlation function to analyse the non-Gaussian clustering on small scales, and thereby, increasing the sensitivity to the underlying cosmological parameters, is an active field of research in cosmology. In this paper, we explore a set of new summary statistics – the k-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions (kNN-CDF). This is the empirical cumulative distribution function of distances from a set of volume-filling, Poisson distributed random points to the k-nearest data points, and is sensitive to all connected N-point correlations in the data. The kNN-CDF can be used to measure counts in cell, void probability distributions, and higher N-point correlation functions, all using the same formalism exploiting fast searches with spatial tree data structures. We demonstrate how it can be computed efficiently from various data sets – both discrete points, and the generalization for continuous fields. We use data from a large suite of N-body simulations to explore the sensitivity of this new statistic to various cosmological parameters, compared to the two-point correlation function, while using the same range of scales. We demonstrate that the use of kNN-CDF improves the constraints on the cosmological parameters by more than a factor of 2 when applied to the clustering of dark matter in the range of scales between 10 and \$40{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$. We also show that relative improvement is even greater when applied on the same scales to the clustering of haloes in the simulations at a fixed number density, both in real space, as well as in redshift space. Since the kNN-CDF are sensitive to all higher order connected correlation functions in the data, the gains over traditional two-point analyses are expected to grow as progressively smaller scales are included in the analysis of cosmological data, provided the higher order correlation functions are sensitive to cosmology on the scales of interest.},
